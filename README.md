# HBnB Evolution

HBnB Evolution is a simplified AirBnB-like platform developed as a software engineering project. The system allows users to register, list properties, manage amenities, and leave reviews, following modern software architecture principles.

This project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on a different stage of system development.

## 📘 Part 1 – Technical Documentation

Part 1 focuses on designing the system before implementation. It defines the structure, components, and interactions of the HBnB application.

### 🔹 What is covered in Part 1

- High-Level System Architecture  
- Business Logic Domain Model  
- API Interaction Flows  

### 🔹 Architecture Style

HBnB uses a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** – APIs and services  
2. **Business Logic Layer** – Core models and rules  
3. **Persistence Layer** – Database interaction  

Communication between the Presentation and Business Logic layers is handled using the **Facade Pattern**, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### 📊 Diagrams Included in Part 1

- High-Level Package Diagram  
- Detailed Class Diagram  
- Sequence Diagrams for API Calls  

These diagrams provide a complete technical blueprint that will guide future implementation phases.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective of HBnB Evolution is to apply software engineering best practices such as:

- Layered architecture  
- UML modeling  
- Clean separation of concerns  
- Maintainable and scalable design
